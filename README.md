### Project Description: Salary Prediction App Using Simple Linear Regression and Streamlit
#### Overview

The Salary Prediction App is a web-based application designed to predict salaries based on years of experience using a simple linear regression model. This project serves as a practical implementation of machine learning concepts, allowing users to interactively input their years of experience and receive an estimated salary prediction. The app leverages the simplicity and efficiency of linear regression to provide insights into salary expectations, helping users make informed career decisions.

The frontend of the Salary Prediction App is designed using Streamlit, a powerful and user-friendly framework for building interactive web applications in Python. The app allows users to input their years of experience and receive a predicted salary based on a pre-trained linear regression model. The use of a .pkl file enables seamless loading of the model, making the prediction process efficient and quick.
